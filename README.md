# TODO
- load the world map properly
- save the previous direction in the undo states
- if you push two text that are on top of each other both of them should move instead of just one
- add particles for when someone dies and moves

## Bugs

- if you go onto keke and go to the left when moving between tiles babu gets drawn below key
- when creating new baba from keke the new baba will not have smooth transitions when moving
- see 5level.l . when you change into the wall and kill walls or stack walls the game will lag hard



you have text-object like BABA  
you have text-verb like is, and  
you have text-quality like YOU
