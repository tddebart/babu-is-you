# TODO
- load the world map properly
- figure out how things like skull rock and wall have a secondary color
- save the previous direction in the undo states

## Bugs

- if you go onto keke and go to the left when moving between tiles babu gets drawn below key
- when creating new baba from keke the new baba will not have smooth transitions when moving
- when you change wall into flag it will undo that action on every undo see 1level.l and change wall into flag
- see 5level.l . when you change into the wall and kill walls or stack walls the game will lag hard



you have text-object like BABA  
you have text-verb like is, and  
you have text-quality like YOU
