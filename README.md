# TODO

- move drawings to game instead of saving it per grid also only load palette once instead of multiple times
- figure out how things like skull rock and wall have a secondary color

## Bugs

- if you go onto keke and go to the left when moving between tiles babu gets drawn below key
- when creating new baba from keke the new baba will not have smooth transitions when moving
- when you change wall into flag it will undo that action on every undo see 1level.l and change wall into flag


## First 7 levels
- [x] wall tiles
- [x] smooth transitions when moving
- [x] import grass and flag
- [ ] make is sink and water
- [ ] make is melt and is hot and lava



you have text-object like BABA  
you have text-verb like is, and  
you have text-quality like YOU
